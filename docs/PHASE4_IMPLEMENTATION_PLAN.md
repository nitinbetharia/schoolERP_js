# Phase 4: Academic Structure Integration - Implementation Plan

## Overview

Phase 4 builds upon the solid foundation of Classes (Phase 1), Sections (Phase 2), and Students (Phase 3) to create a comprehensive academic structure. This phase integrates subjects, teachers, and academic calendar management to form the backbone of the school's academic operations.

## Implementation Strategy

### 🎯 Core Components

#### 1. Subjects Management Service

**File:** `services/SubjectsService.js`
**Purpose:** Complete subject lifecycle management with academic integration

**Key Features:**

- Subject CRUD operations with validation
- Class-wise subject assignment
- Subject categories (Core, Elective, Co-curricular)
- Subject sequences and prerequisites
- Teacher-subject assignments
- Academic year integration
- Multi-tenant subject management

#### 2. Teachers Management Service

**File:** `services/TeachersService.js`
**Purpose:** Teacher profile and assignment management

**Key Features:**

- Teacher profile management (personal, professional, qualifications)
- Subject specialization tracking
- Class and section assignments
- Academic role assignments (HOD, Class Teacher, Subject Coordinator)
- Teacher availability and schedule management
- Performance tracking integration
- Multi-tenant teacher management

#### 3. Academic Calendar Service

**File:** `services/AcademicCalendarService.js`
**Purpose:** Academic year and term management

**Key Features:**

- Academic year definition and management
- Term/semester structure setup
- Holiday and vacation planning
- Academic milestone tracking
- Examination schedule integration
- Event calendar management
- Multi-tenant calendar isolation

### 📊 Database Relationships

#### Subject Model Integration

```javascript
// Subject relationships
Subject.belongsToMany(Class, { through: 'ClassSubjects', as: 'classes' });
Subject.belongsToMany(Teacher, { through: 'TeacherSubjects', as: 'teachers' });
Subject.hasMany(SubjectPrerequisite, { foreignKey: 'subject_id', as: 'prerequisites' });

// Class-Subject relationships
Class.belongsToMany(Subject, { through: 'ClassSubjects', as: 'subjects' });
ClassSubjects.belongsTo(Subject, { foreignKey: 'subject_id', as: 'subject' });
ClassSubjects.belongsTo(Class, { foreignKey: 'class_id', as: 'class' });
```

#### Teacher Model Integration

```javascript
// Teacher relationships
Teacher.belongsToMany(Subject, { through: 'TeacherSubjects', as: 'subjects' });
Teacher.belongsToMany(Class, { through: 'TeacherClasses', as: 'classes' });
Teacher.belongsToMany(Section, { through: 'TeacherSections', as: 'sections' });
Teacher.hasMany(TeacherQualification, { foreignKey: 'teacher_id', as: 'qualifications' });
```

#### Academic Calendar Integration

```javascript
// Academic Calendar relationships
AcademicYear.hasMany(Term, { foreignKey: 'academic_year_id', as: 'terms' });
AcademicYear.hasMany(Holiday, { foreignKey: 'academic_year_id', as: 'holidays' });
AcademicYear.hasMany(AcademicEvent, { foreignKey: 'academic_year_id', as: 'events' });
```

### 🔧 Technical Implementation

#### Service Layer Architecture

```
Phase 4 Services:
- SubjectsService.js     (Subject management and assignments)
- TeachersService.js     (Teacher profiles and assignments)
- AcademicCalendarService.js (Academic year and calendar)

Integration with Existing:
- ClassesService.js      (Phase 1 - Enhanced with subject integration)
- SectionsService.js     (Phase 2 - Enhanced with teacher assignments)
- StudentsService.js     (Phase 3 - Enhanced with academic tracking)
```

#### Route Structure

```
📁 routes/web/
├── subjects.js          (Subject management routes)
├── teachers.js          (Teacher management routes)
├── academic-calendar.js (Academic calendar routes)
├── classes.js          (Enhanced with subjects)
├── sections.js         (Enhanced with teachers)
└── students.js         (Enhanced with academic context)
```
