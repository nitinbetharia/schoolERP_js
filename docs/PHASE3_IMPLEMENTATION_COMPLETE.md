**Advanced Capabilities:**

```javascript
// Bulk operations
bulkImportFromCSV(filePath, tenantCode, userId);
bulkUpdateStudents(updates, tenantCode);
exportToCSV(filters, tenantCode);

// Student lifecycle
transferStudent(studentId, newClassId, newSectionId, tenantCode);
generateAdmissionNumber(tenantCode);
getStudentAcademicHistory(studentId, tenantCode);

// Analytics
getStudentsStatistics(tenantCode);
getClassWiseDistribution(tenantCode);
getAgeDistribution(tenantCode);
```

- **Breadcrumb Navigation:** Clear navigation hierarchy
- **Multi-tenant Security:** Proper tenant isolation in all operations

### 🔧 Technical Architecture

#### Service Layer Pattern

```
Routes (Web Interface)
    ↓ (Validation & Authentication)
StudentsService (Business Logic)
    ↓ (Database Operations)
Models (Sequelize ORM)
    ↓ (Multi-tenant Support)
Database (Tenant-specific Tables)
```

#### Data Flow

1. **Request Validation:** Joi schemas validate all input data
2. **Authentication Check:** Role-based access control
3. **Service Processing:** Business logic and data manipulation
4. **Database Operations:** Sequelize ORM with proper relationships
5. **Response Formatting:** User-friendly success/error messages

### 📊 Database Integration

#### Student Model Relationships

```javascript
Student.belongsTo(Class, { foreignKey: 'class_id', as: 'class' });
Student.belongsTo(Section, { foreignKey: 'section_id', as: 'section' });
Student.hasMany(Parent, { foreignKey: 'student_id', as: 'parents' });
Student.hasMany(MedicalRecord, { foreignKey: 'student_id', as: 'medical_records' });
Student.hasMany(AcademicHistory, { foreignKey: 'student_id', as: 'academic_history' });
```

#### Multi-tenant Support

- Tenant code isolation in all queries
- Proper foreign key relationships
- Data segregation between different schools

### 🚀 Advanced Features

#### CSV Import/Export System

- **Import Validation:** Field validation, duplicate detection, error reporting
- **Export Filtering:** Advanced filtering options for targeted exports
- **Error Handling:** Detailed error reports for failed imports
- **Progress Tracking:** Import/export status monitoring

#### Parent Management

- Multiple parents/guardians per student
- Relationship types (Father, Mother, Guardian)
- Contact information management
- Access control for parent accounts

#### Academic Tracking

- Historical grade records
- Class progression tracking
- Performance analytics
- Attendance integration (prepared for Phase 7)
