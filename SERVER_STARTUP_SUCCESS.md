# 🎉 Server Startup Issues - RESOLVED!

## ✅ SUCCESS: School ERP Server is Now Running

The server startup issues have been completely resolved. Here's what was fixed:

### 🚨 **Critical Issues Resolved**

#### **1. SQL Syntax Error**

- **Problem**: MySQL reserved word `current_time` used as column alias
- **Location**: `start-server.js` line 101
- **Error**: `You have an error in your SQL syntax; check the manual that corresponds to your MySQL server version for the right syntax to use near 'current_time' at line 1`
- **Solution**: Changed `NOW() as current_time` to `NOW() AS server_time`

#### **2. JavaScript Syntax Error**

- **Problem**: Corrupted code at beginning of auth.js file
- **Location**: `routes/web/auth.js` line 4
- **Error**: `SyntaxError: Unexpected token ')'`
- **Solution**: Fixed corrupted require statement and properly positioned test route

### 🔧 **Additional Fixes Applied**

- ✅ Fixed missing test file references
- ✅ Corrected EJS template paths
- ✅ Updated frontend JavaScript API calls
- ✅ Removed unused imports
- ✅ All syntax validation passes

### 🚀 **Current Status**
