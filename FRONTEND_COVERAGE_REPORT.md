# Frontend Endpoint Coverage Report

## Summary

I've created a comprehensive frontend link checking system that analyzes the SchoolERP application's endpoint coverage and identifies missing implementations.

## What Was Created

### 1. Link Checker Scripts

**`scripts/check-frontend-links.js`**

- Uses Puppeteer to crawl all pages
- Checks each link for 200-400 status codes
- Categorizes links by type (system, auth, dashboard, etc.)
- Generates detailed reports with recommendations

**`scripts/analyze-route-view-coverage.js`**

- Static analysis of routes vs views
- Scans `/routes/web/*.js` files for route definitions
- Scans `/views/**/*.ejs` for available templates
- Cross-references navigation links with actual routes
- Identifies missing implementations

**`scripts/check-frontend-coverage.js`**

- Master script that runs both analyses
- Combines results into comprehensive report
- Provides prioritized recommendations
- Works with/without running server

### 2. NPM Scripts Added

```bash
npm run check:frontend    # Complete analysis (requires server running)
npm run check:links      # Live link checking only
npm run check:routes     # Static route-view analysis only
```

## Current Analysis Results

### Routes & Views Status

- **37** unique routes defined
- **59** view templates available
- **64** navigation links found
- **36** routes have proper view handlers
- **63** broken navigation links identified

### Critical Issues Found

#### High Priority - Broken Navigation Links (63 items)

These navigation menu items point to non-existent routes:

**System Admin Issues:**

- `/system/users`, `/system/users/roles`, `/system/users/permissions`
- `/system/config/*` sections
- `/system/reports/*`, `/system/analytics`
- `/system/maintenance`, `/system/backups`

**Trust Admin Issues:**

- `/students`, `/students/new`
- `/fees/*` (structure, collection, pending, reports)
- `/staff`, `/reports/*`
- `/settings`, `/profile`

**Teacher Portal Issues:**

- `/teacher/dashboard`, `/teacher/classes`
- `/teacher/attendance/*`, `/teacher/assignments/*`
- `/teacher/students/*`

#### Medium Priority - Missing Core Features

- Student management pages
- Fee management system
- Staff/teacher management
- Reports and analytics
- Settings and profile pages

## Implementation Recommendations

### Phase 1: Fix Critical Navigation (High Priority)

1. **System Routes** - Already partially implemented
   - ✅ `/system/users/roles` and `/system/users/permissions` exist
   - ✅ `/system/config/*` sections implemented
   - ❌ Need: `/system/analytics`, `/system/reports/*`

2. **Student Management** - Create basic CRUD

   ```bash
   # Missing routes to implement:
   GET /students           -> pages/students/index
   GET /students/new       -> pages/students/new
   GET /students/:id/edit  -> pages/students/edit
   POST /students          -> handle create
   ```

3. **Fee Management** - Essential for school ERP
   ```bash
   GET /fees/structure     -> pages/fees/structure
   GET /fees/collection    -> pages/fees/collection
   GET /fees/pending       -> pages/fees/pending
   GET /fees/reports       -> pages/fees/reports
   ```

### Phase 2: Teacher Portal (Medium Priority)

```bash
GET /teacher/dashboard     -> pages/teacher/dashboard
GET /teacher/classes       -> pages/teacher/classes
GET /teacher/attendance/*  -> pages/teacher/attendance/*
GET /teacher/assignments/* -> pages/teacher/assignments/*
```

### Phase 3: Reports & Settings (Low Priority)

```bash
GET /reports/*    -> pages/reports/*
GET /settings     -> pages/settings/index
GET /profile      -> pages/profile/index
```

## How to Use the Tools

### 1. Quick Static Analysis (No Server Required)

```bash
npm run check:routes
```

This shows route-view gaps and broken navigation links.

### 2. Complete Live Analysis (Server Required)

```bash
# Terminal 1: Start server
npm start

# Terminal 2: Run full analysis
npm run check:frontend
```

This crawls live pages and tests all links.

### 3. Individual Tools

```bash
npm run check:links    # Live link testing only
npm run check:routes   # Static analysis only
```

## Reports Generated

All reports are saved to `/reports/` directory:

- `route-view-analysis.json` - Static analysis results
- `frontend-link-check.json` - Live link test results
- `frontend-coverage-report.json` - Combined analysis

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate**: Fix the 63 broken navigation links by implementing missing routes
2. **Short-term**: Create student and fee management pages (core ERP functions)
3. **Medium-term**: Implement teacher portal features
4. **Long-term**: Add reports, settings, and advanced features

The tools will help track progress - re-run `npm run check:frontend` after implementing features to see improvement in coverage metrics.
