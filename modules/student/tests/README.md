   - Academic performance tracking
   - Graduation processing

3. **Administrative Scenarios**:
   - Bulk operations for year-end processing
   - Disciplinary actions and status changes
   - Document management and verification
   - Fee structure management
   - Transport and hostel requirements

### Data Validation Coverage

1. **Field Validation**:
   - Required field validation
   - Data type validation
   - Format validation (dates, phone numbers, emails)
   - Range validation (age limits, income ranges)
   - Enumerated value validation (gender, categories, status)

2. **Business Rule Validation**:
   - Age restrictions for class assignments
   - Duplicate admission number prevention
   - Unique email/phone validation
   - Academic year consistency
   - Class capacity limits

3. **Relationship Integrity**:
   - Student-School relationship validation
   - Student-Class-Section assignment consistency
   - Academic year progression rules
   - Parent/guardian information completeness

## Testing Procedures

### Pre-Test Setup

1. **Database Preparation**:

   ```bash
   # Ensure clean database state
   npm run db:reset
   npm run db:migrate
   npm run db:seed
   ```

2. **Authentication Setup**:
   - Login with appropriate user roles
   - Verify session management
   - Test role-based access controls

3. **Basic Data Setup**:
   - Create test schools
   - Set up class and section structure
   - Configure academic years

### Test Execution Order

1. **Basic API Tests** → Validate core functionality
2. **Lifecycle Tests** → Verify business processes
3. **Integration Tests** → Test complete workflows
4. **Performance Tests** → Validate scalability

### Expected Results
